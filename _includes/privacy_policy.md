## Checkmarks Privacy Policy

Last modified: September 23, 2015

This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Checkmarks ("Application") for mobile and PC devices that was created by Alex Hinz.


### What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?

#### User Provided Information

The Checkmarks Application obtains the information you provide when you download the Application or provide Feedback through the Application. Signing in with an account is optional. However, please keep in mind that you may not be able to use some of the features offered by the Application unless you sign in.

When you sign in and use the Application, you generally provide (a) your user name, password, and other account information; (b) transaction-related information, such as when you make purchases, respond to any offers, or download or use applications from us; (c) information you provide us when you contact us for help, for information, or to give feedback, and; (d) information you enter into our system when using the Application, such as task information.

We will not use the User Provided Information for marketing or ads, nor will we sell the information to third parties. We may use the information you provided us to contact you in response to a request from you, such as when you email us; or to deliver required notices.

#### Google Tasks integration

The Checkmarks Application optionally allows you to sign in with your Google Account credentials in order to sync information through Google Tasks. For the security and privacy of your account credentials, the Application does not store your username or password credentials. Instead you enter them into a sign in form provided by Google, and the Application receives a unique token that allows it to sync task information. Once you sign in, any tasks information you have previously entered into the Application may be synced to the signed-in Google Account for the purposes of syncing your task information between devices on which you have installed the Application.

#### Automatically Collected Information

In addition, the Application may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of device you use, your device's unique device ID, the IP address of your device, your operating system version, the type your network connection, and information about the way you use the Application. This information will be used only to improve the Application, and will not be used to identify you.


### Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?

This Application does not collect precise information about the location of your mobile device.


### Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?

Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to help us improve the Application and our service. We will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.

We may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:

- as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;
- when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
- with our trusted services providers who work on our behalf, do not have an independent use of the information we disclose to them, and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this privacy statement.
- if Checkmarks or Alex Hinz is involved in an acquisition, merger, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of this information, as well as any choices you may have regarding this information.
- if you sign in to Google Tasks with a Google Account, your task information and any account information you provide during sign in may be provided to Google and will be governed separately by the [Google Terms of Service](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/) and the [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/).


### What are my opt-out rights?

You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling the Application. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your PC or mobile device or via the application marketplace or network.


### Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information

We will retain User Provided data for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. We will retain Automatically Collected information for up to 30 days and thereafter may store it in aggregate.


### Security

We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Application. Sensitive data stored by the Application, such as your Google Account sign in tokens, are stored encrypted. Online syncing and transmission of Automatically Collected Information is performed over a secure connection. Please be aware that although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.


### Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason and without notice. We will make available any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy at [http://checkmarks.alexhinz.com/privacy_policy](http://checkmarks.alexhinz.com/privacy_policy). You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.


### Your Consent

By using the Application, you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "Processing" means using cookies on a computer or mobile device or using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining, analyzing, and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the United States.
